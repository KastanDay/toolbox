Useful ML engineering libraries and scripts

* Great "new computer" or "new remote server" Zsh install scripts via [.dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)
* Excellent tmux config. [Oh My Tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) is a good alternative.
* All my preferred terminal utilities like `glances`, `bat`, `lsd`, `nvitop`, (or info-rich `apt install nvtop` when you have sudo), `ripgrep`, `ag`.
